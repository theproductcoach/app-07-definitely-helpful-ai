# Definitely Helpful AI

The most *ahem* "helpful" AI assistant you'll ever meet. It's not sarcastic at all. Really. Trust us.

## Features

- ðŸ’¬ Totally "useful" responses to all your questions
- ðŸŽ­ Absolutely "professional" demeanor
- ðŸ¤– State-of-the-art "assistance" technology
- ðŸ“± Beautiful chat interface (no, really, this part is true)
- ðŸ”„ Clear chat functionality (when you've had enough "help")
- âš¡ Lightning-fast responses (we spare no time in being "helpful")

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Zero AI calls (we're "smart" enough without them)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to experience the "magic".

## How It Works

1. Type your question in the chat
2. Receive our AI's most..."thoughtful" response
3. Marvel at its "incredible" problem-solving abilities
4. Try not to laugh (okay, you can laugh)
5. Clear the chat when you need a fresh start
6. Repeat for endless "productivity"

## Warning

Side effects may include:

- Uncontrollable eye-rolling
- Sudden bursts of laughter
- Increased appreciation for actual helpful AI
- Mild frustration (but in a fun way)
- Addiction to sarcastic responses

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://30-in-30-app-7.vercel.app/](https://30-in-30-app-7.vercel.app/)

*Note: No AI was harmed in the making of this app. Though its pride might have taken a hit.*

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
