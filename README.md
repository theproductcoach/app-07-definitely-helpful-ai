# Definitely Helpful AI

The most *ahem* "helpful" AI assistant you'll ever meet. It's guaranteed to provide the most unique responses to all your inquiries. Trust us, it's "revolutionary".

## Features

- ðŸ’¬ Spectacularly "insightful" responses to all your questions
- ðŸŽ­ An AI with more personality than most humans
- ðŸ¤– Advanced AI technology (that somehow missed the "helpful" class in AI school)
- ðŸ“± Beautiful, responsive chat interface (this part is genuinely good)
- ðŸ”„ Clear chat functionality (for when you need a fresh start after all that "wisdom")
- ðŸŒŠ Real-time streaming responses that arrive character by character
- ðŸ¤” GPT integration that somehow manages to be both smart and useless simultaneously

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React 19
- OpenAI API integration
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Edge Runtime for streaming responses

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to experience the "magic".

## How It Works

1. Type your question in the chat
2. Watch as our AI carefully considers your query
3. Receive a response that is... well, definitely something
4. Try not to laugh (or cry, depending on your question)
5. Clear the chat when you need a fresh start
6. Repeat for endless "enlightenment"

## Warning

Side effects may include:

- Sudden bursts of laughter
- Questioning everything you know about AI
- Increased appreciation for actually helpful assistants
- Mild confusion followed by amusement
- Showing your friends "the worst AI ever" (which was our goal all along)

## The Science Behind It

Our AI has been meticulously trained to provide responses that are:

- Technically coherent but practically useless
- Delivered with unwavering confidence
- Occasionally profound in their absurdity
- Guaranteed to never solve your actual problem

## Deployment

The app features a real OpenAI integration with streaming responses, so it feels like a genuine AI assistant (just not a helpful one).

*Note: No AI was harmed in the making of this app, though its reputation for helpfulness might have taken a hit.*

## Credits
